# Subjective Face Transform

Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15381

Abstract: Humans tend to form quick subjective first impressions of non-physical attributes when seeing someone's face, such as perceived trustworthiness or attractiveness. To understand what variations in a face lead to different subjective impressions, this work uses generative models to find semantically meaningful edits to a face image that change perceived attributes. Unlike prior work that relied on statistical manipulation in feature space, our end-to-end framework considers trade-offs between preserving identity and changing perceptual attributes. It maps identity-preserving latent space directions to changes in attribute scores, enabling transformation of any input face along an attribute axis according to a target change. We train on real and synthetic faces, evaluate for in-domain and out-of-domain images using predictive models and human ratings, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach. Ultimately, such a framework can be used to understand and explain biases in subjective interpretation of faces that are not dependent on the identity.

## Acknowledgements

We implement the [HyperInverter](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/HyperInverter) setup for [projection and inversion](https://github.com/CV-Lehigh/subjective_face_transform/tree/main#inversion-dependencies) of face images in the GAN latent space. The [first impression prediction](https://github.com/CV-Lehigh/subjective_face_transform/tree/main#first-impression-prediction-models) models are trained based on directives mentioned in the paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Subjective Face Attributes](https://github.com/mel-2445/Predicting-First-Impressions). We build upon the initial code of [StyleFlow](https://github.com/RameenAbdal/StyleFlow) to create a [mapping model](https://github.com/CV-Lehigh/subjective_face_transform/tree/main#mapping-models) between the input faces and the corresponding subjective scores of attributes like Attractiveness, Dominance, and Trustworthiness.
